To use tree.js:

1. Ensure it is included in your page somehow.
2. For best results, add the control to a div with a background colour that contrasts the tree's   	colour. The default colour of the tree is white, this can be changed in tree_styles.css.
3.Build the tree that you want to display. This should be a tree object.
4.Create a new TreeControl: myvar = new TreeControl(tree, divID)
5.Call TreeControl.display();
